the rate of radioactive decay is directly proportional to the amount of the radioactive material, such that

dR/dt = k*N
	where R is the rate of decay, k is a constant probability, and N is mols remaining

d(theta)/dt = -g/l*sin(theta)
	where g is the gravitational constant, l is the length of the pendulum, and theta is the angle from the center

dV/dt = V/(RC)
	where V is the voltage across the capacitor and R and C are the constants in ohms and farads, respectively
