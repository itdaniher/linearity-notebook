4a)

This one is harder to conceptualise - we're tasked with relating two sets of equations:

a homogenous system:

dxdt = 4x
x = exp(4t)

an inhomogenous system:

dxdt = 4x + 1
x = -1/4

The stated relation we're exploring is that 

x = a*x_h + x_p
for the equation:

dxdt = 4x + 1

such that:

x = a * exp(4t) - 1/4

we're comparing this formulation with the provided value of dxdt, so let's integrate the provided value:

dxdt = 4x + 1
dx = (4x+1)*dt
x = (4x+1)*t

....

picking this up later.
