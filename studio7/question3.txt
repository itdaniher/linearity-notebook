two parts... first, educated guesses:

a) -6
b) +3, -3
c) -1, +1, possibly \pm i?

these guesses are derived by basic algebra and some extrapolation / half-remembered algorithm for dealing with double and triple derivs

the second half of this would be actually working through the algebra in sympy and validating my guesses... maybe later!
