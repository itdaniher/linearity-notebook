a) linear combination is pretty easy to make out as:

X(n) = (1/2)**n*5*U[0]+(1/2)**(n-4)*U[4]

where U[n] is the step function at a specified index

b) This one is odd. I'd like to here how Professor Hoffman would solve this... 

X(n) = (1/2)**n+a**n*n doesn't look right

X(n) = (1/2+log(a))**n... isolate the exponent... idk.
