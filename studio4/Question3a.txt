There's one solution if the determinant is a real number - looking at the formulation of the determinant as the product of the diagonal in row echelon form, it's pretty easy to see that as long as you have an upper triangular matrix, you'll have a non-zero determinant.
If the determinant is zero, there're either infinitely many, or zero solutions.
