let's call Î» l for awhile...

i) (l**2-(0.5+0.5)*l+(0.25-0.16)) = 0

- this formulation looks quite familiar... it reduces to the expansion from part A!

spiffy! looks familiar! same eigenvalues!

and looking at these eigenvalues, no matter what our starting point, we'll to trend to zero...

so our final solution is (0,0)
