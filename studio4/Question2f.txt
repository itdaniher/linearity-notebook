l is an eigenvalue of a n by n matrix A

i) fact - columns are linearly dependent
ii) fact - these would be the eigenvectors?
iii) fact - definitional, but to expand if you have a matrix in reduced echelon form, and you broadcast your eigenvalues across the identity matrix and subtract, you'll an un-invertable matrix with a linearly dependent row of all zeros
