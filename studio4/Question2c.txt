D shrinks along both axes, along one much faster than the other (9x?)

R(pi/4) applies this manipulation at a 45 degree angle to the axes, so that Yn will trend towards zero via a different set of axes

ii) fact, the difference between the axes diminishes as they approach zero

iii) fact, verified earlier

iv) fact, definitional?

v) they're similar as they have the same eigenvalues, and thus the same general behavior, even if they differ in application of axes

vi) the transformations are the same, albiet applied across different axes - as theta approaches zero, the two parallel transformations between A and D become identical
