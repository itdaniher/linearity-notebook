No need for fancy tools here...

1) 

a - this is an overdetermined system, with more rows than columns, but the vector [0,0,0,0] is a homogenous solution

b - this is an underdetermined system, with more variables than equations

c - overdetermined system, but with no solutions, as 0*x+0*y+0*z=4 is unsatisfyable

d - underdetermined system, with no solutions - more equations than variables
