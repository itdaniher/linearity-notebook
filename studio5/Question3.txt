A)

A = Arr('5/8 1/8 1/8; 1/3 0 1/3; 1/24 21/24 13/24')

There's not really much to be said here.

Our dominant eigenvalue is 1, associated with the eigenvector [1, 1, 2],
    in which half the blame is assigned to the executive branch

B) well, there's no nice way to put this, besides.... 1/2(sqrt(5)+1)

the ratio of branches to twigs is 1:phi as t->oo
